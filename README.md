## Setup

Install dependencies, ideally using `pnpm i` to get the same dependencies I used. `npm i` should also work (lock file
ignored). <br/>
You may need a reasonably modern version of Node. I used 18.16.0

## Commands

Start: `pnpm dev` / `npm run dev`  <br/>
Test: `pnpm test` / `npm run test` <br/>
Lint: `pnpm lint` / `npm run lint`
